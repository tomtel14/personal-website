# Personal Portfolio Website

* One of the first websites I built. Used HTML, CSS and some plain javascript to deal with the interactive elements/features. 

* Built using mobile-first approach, this responsive site includes an about me section, tech section and project section.

* Enabled me to experiment with CSS animations while giving me my first practical experiences using CSS layout tools such as grid and flexbox.
