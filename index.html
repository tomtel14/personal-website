          <p>I’m a self-taught front-end developer based in North London with a passion for front-end tech and a desire
            to learn as much as possible on my journey to become a full-time dev!</p>
          <p>Over the past year or so, I’ve been using all the resources available to me to teach myself the most
            important languages, libraries and frameworks required to become a front-end web developer.</p>
          <p>In the process of doing so, I’ve built countless apps and webpages, some of which can be found on my <a
              href="https://github.com/tomtel14" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
            account. At the start of my journey, I took the opportunity to work for my parent’s company, Genial, who
            develop websites for local businesses. This gave me experience of carrying out updates, maintenance and
            optimisation of websites for a selection of their clients. More recently, I’ve worked closely with my own
            clients to successfully design, develop and deploy websites which meet their needs.</p>
          <p>My background actually lies in engineering, specifically in the automotive industry where I’ve worked for
            manufacturers including Ford and Rolls-Royce. However, I’m now excited to bring my problem-solving mind-set,
            along with my newly acquired skills, into a new collaborative environment where I can continue to learn and
            experiment with the latest tech every day!</p>

        <h2>Tech</h2>
      </div>

      <article class="tech-section section-center">
        <p>Some of the tech I've enjoyed using so far:</p>
        <ul class="tech-list-container">
          <li class="tech-list-item">
            <span>HTML</span>
            <p> I have a good understanding and
              appreciation of the benefits of writing semantic HTML so I always do my best to write clean and
              easy to read
              HTML. Same applies to JSX when working with React.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="tech-list-item">
            <span>CSS</span>
            <p>Getting to grips with the layout techniques which CSS has to offer has been great! Using Flexbox
              and Grid in combination with media queries has enabled me to create responsive web apps.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="tech-list-item">
            <span>SASS</span>
            <p>Learning SASS massively helped me organise and tidy up my CSS code, making it far more manageable
              and easier to work with. Easy to use with React too.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="tech-list-item">
            <span>JavaScript</span>
            <p>I’ve really enjoyed learning the many concepts behind JavaScript. I made sure to be comfortable with
              vanilla JavaScript before moving onto other JS libraries.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="tech-list-item">
            <span>React JS</span>
            <p>Definitely the technology I’m most excited about. React forces you to think carefully about how to
              structure your app and manage the flow of data.
              I've really enjoyed using it to build interactive UI's while working with state within components.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="tech-list-item">
            <span>Bootstrap</span>
            <p>My first CSS framework I experimented with. The grid system is excellent and makes it easy to
              quickly
              knock up responsive webpages which are easy on the eye.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="tech-list-item">
            <span>BEM</span>
            <p>BEM works really well together with SASS and has further improved the maintainability of my code.
              I really like how it eliminates specificity issues.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="tech-list-item">
            <span>Git/GitHub</span>
            <p>I'm familiar with the majority of git commands and now make use of branches to make pull requests for my
              own projects. More useful for teams but still beneficial when working solo.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="tech-list-item">
            <span>DevTools</span>
            <p>Basically the swiss army knife of front-end development. Perfect for debugging and performance
              optimisation.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="tech-list-item">
            <span>VS Code</span>
            <p>My favourite editor. Easy to use without being overly complicated. The integrated terminal is
              handy too!</p>
          </li>
